// in js case-sensitivity is important so we have to be careful about the case of the variable names
// the most common error is to use a variable name with the wrong case
// mostly peole use camelCase for variable names
// example:
var myVariable = "I am a variable";
console.log(myvariable); // this will throw an error because the variable name is not the same as the one declared  in the first line

// myVariable and myvariable are two different variables
// so we have to be careful about the case of the variable names

// more examples:
var TitleCaseOver;
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var lowerCamelCase;
var snake_case;

// All of the above are valid variable names in js

// Assignment:
var TitleCaseOver = "I am a variable";
var StUdLyCapVaR = "I am a variable";
var properCamelCase = "I am a variable";
var lowerCamelCase = "I am a variable";
var snake_case = "I am a variable";
