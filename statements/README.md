# JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are instructions that a web browser executes. These statements are composed of values, operators, expressions, keywords, and comments. Each statement is executed in sequence, and they form the core of any JavaScript program.

## Examples of JavaScript Statements

### Variable Declaration
```javascript
let x = 5;
const y = 10;
```

### Conditional Statement
```javascript
if (x < y) {
    console.log("x is less than y");
} else {
    console.log("x is greater than or equal to y");
}
```

### Loop Statement
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

### Function Declaration
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Return Statement
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Expression Statement
```javascript
let z = x + y;
```

### Block Statement
```javascript
{
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    console.log(a + b);
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many types of statements you can use in JavaScript to control the flow of your program and perform various operations.
